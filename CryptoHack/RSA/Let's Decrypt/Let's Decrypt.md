### Solution

The given Python script attempts to solve a challenge related to RSA signatures on the website CryptoHack. It generates two large prime numbers and calculates their product N. It then connects to the remote server and requests a signature for a given option. The script prepares the message by encoding it using the PKCS#1 v1.5 padding scheme and attempts to recover N from the signature and the encoded message. The script then sets e to 1 and sends a message to the server containing the recovered N, e, and the original message, along with an option to verify the signature. Finally, the script prints the response received from the server, which presumably indicates whether the signature was successfully verified.
