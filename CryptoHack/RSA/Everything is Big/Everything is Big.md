### Solution

Look at file Output.txt, we saw that e is very large, so d is relatively small.

Therefore, we can find it using [Weiner's attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%27s_attack) to solve.

The **continued_fractions function** is used to generate continued fractions of a rational number.

The **find_pqdtot function** is the main implementation of the Wiener's attack.
