### Solution

We find the smallest primitive element g of the prime number p = 28151 by checking all possible values of g until a primitive element is found. A primitive element is a generator of the multiplicative group of integers modulo p, and there is no known efficient algorithm to find primitive elements of large prime numbers. The program prints the smallest primitive element g found.
