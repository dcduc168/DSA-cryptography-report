### Solution

The idea is an implementation of a simplified version of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol with a twist. The goal is to establish a shared **secret key between two parties**, Alice and Bob, **over an insecure communication channel, such as the internet**, without exchanging the secret key directly. The shared key can then be used to encrypt and decrypt messages exchanged between the parties.

It then waits to receive two JSON objects from Alice containing the **prime modulus p, generator g, and Alice's public key A**. These parameters are used in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol to generate a shared secret key.

Next, the code generates a new prime modulus that has smooth factors using the provided smooth_p value. The smooth_p value is a precomputed large prime number that is known to have smooth factors, i.e., its factors are small primes, making it easier to perform certain cryptographic attacks. The use of such primes is discouraged in practice.

The code sends a JSON object to Alice containing the new prime modulus, generator, and Bob's public key B, which is generated by raising the generator to a random secret exponent b. Alice computes the shared secret key by raising Bob's public key B to her random secret exponent a, which is used to compute her public key A. Similarly, Bob computes the shared secret key by raising Alice's public key A to his secret exponent b.

Finally, the code decrypts a message encrypted using the shared secret key and prints it to the console.
