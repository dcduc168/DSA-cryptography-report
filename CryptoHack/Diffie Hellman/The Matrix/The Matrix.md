### Solution

We need to create the code that reads a file containing encrypted data, performs some arithmetic operations on the data using a finite field and an exponentiation, extracts a portion of the resulting matrix as a binary string, converts that string into a readable string, and prints it to the console. The resulting string is likely to be the decrypted flag.
