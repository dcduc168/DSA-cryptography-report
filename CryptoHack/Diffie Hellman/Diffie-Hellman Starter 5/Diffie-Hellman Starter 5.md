### Solution

The code provided is a simple implementation of a symmetric key encryption algorithm using AES in CBC mode. It includes functions for encrypting and decrypting a flag message, as well as a check for PKCS7 padding. The script also generates a shared secret key using Diffie-Hellman key exchange and uses it to encrypt and decrypt the flag. A sample key, IV, and ciphertext are provided to demonstrate the decryption of the flag.
