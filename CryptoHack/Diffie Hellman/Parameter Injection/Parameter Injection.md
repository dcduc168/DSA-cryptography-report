### Solution

I sent Alice's info to Bob and then I didn't care about Bob answer :

I just sent {B:"0x1"} (which is possible because g is supposed to be a generator) to Alice so that I know the shared key which is 1

I Used the script from "Diffie-Hellman Starter 5" to decrypt the flag after recovering the shared secret.
